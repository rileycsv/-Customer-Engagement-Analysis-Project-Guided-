# -Customer-Engagement-Analysis-Project-Guided-
Guided me(a beginner in the Data Analytics field) on real life analysis problems using Excel.

This is offered on https://learn.365datascience.com/projects/customer-engagement-analysis-in-excel/.
At the end, you are given a quiz based on the information you got from your tasks. I was able to get 6/8 right!

**Things that I have learned:**
-make sure to make the analysis readable because of your future self and others
-stop and think what you are trying to accomplish with the data you are trying to find

**Things that I am proud that I did:**
-Use keyboard for majority of my time in Excel (building the habit)
-Calculate means, medians, and variable samples well.
-Creating T two sample tables
-Creating F two sample tables

Here are some images from Task 3 when I was collecting data from functions:
